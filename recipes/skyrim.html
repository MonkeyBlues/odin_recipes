    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><strong>Preparing the Sweet Rolls:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. To prepare the muffin tray, cut small squares of greaseproof paper and stuff them into each muffin well – create folds and crinkles and then smooth them out to help create a rustic, uneven finish to the cakes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl cream the butter, sugar, vanilla extract and maple syrup together until pale and creamy. Add the eggs one and a time and mix well.</li>
        <li>Sift in the self-raising flour and cinnamon then add the milk and stir gently until a smooth batter forms.</li>
        <li>Fill the prepared muffin tray with the batter, filling each well nearly to the top and place in the pre-heated oven for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown (a skewer inserted should come out clean when cooked thoroughly). Set aside and allow to cool completely while you prepare the syrup and frosting.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Making the Frosting:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the cream cheese, butter and vanilla extract in a bowl and mix gently until combined.</li>
        <li>Slowly sift in the icing/confectioners sugar and stir gently. Allow to chill in the fridge before using.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Making the Cinnamon Syrup:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pan on a medium-high heat melt the butter, sugar and cinnamon together until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside for use later.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Making the Sweet Rolls:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Unwrap the cakes from the paper and careful slice the puffy top off the cake. Turn the cake upside down so that the cut top is now the bottom.</li>
        <li>Cut a small hole in the top of the cake that’s about 1cm deep and 1cm across. Pour a little of the cinnamon syrup into the hole.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the frosting over the top of the cake and serve.</li>
    </ol>
