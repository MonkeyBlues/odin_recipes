    <p><strong>Curry</strong></p>
    <ul>   
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 lbs chicken thighs, cut into bit sized pieced</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala, ground</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 red onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>5 carrots, peeled and cut into bit sized pieces</li>
        <li>3 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into bit sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 apple, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>15 grams dark chocolate</li>
        <li>1/2 cup greek yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a deep pot over medium-high heat. Saute the onions and garlic with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with salt, pepper, and 2 tsp of garam masala. Add the chicken to the pot and cook until browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots, chicken stock, water, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and grated apples. Place the lid slightly ajar and simmer for 30 minutes. Occasionally skim any foam that appears.</li>
        <li>While the chicken and vegetables are simmering, take the time to make the roux base. In a small bowl, combine the flour and spices. In a pan, over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the flour and spices to the melted butter.</li>
        <li>Mix together until the flour has absorbed all the butter. Add the tomato paste, tonkatsu, and honey. Once everything is together, turn off the heat and set aside until the simmering is done.</li>
        <li>Take a small portion of the roux and place it in a ladle. Place the ladle in the liquid of the pot and slowly mix in the roux. This will have to be down in several batches. Take your time with this to make sure it mixes well together.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the chocolate and yogurt. Keep in mind that chocolate and yogurt will dull some of the kick of the curry, so taste as you do this to reach the spiciness you are going for. Serve with rice.</li>
    </ol>
