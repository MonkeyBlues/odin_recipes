    <p><em>"When Axel gets back, let's ask him. Then all three of us can have ice cream together!"</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cup cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>Teal gel-based food coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together 1 ½ cups each of high quality milk and cream. Combine 3 Tbsp cornstarch in about 1 cup of milk and cream mixture until it is dissolved and no lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Bring the remaining milk and cream mixture close to a simmer on the stovetop. Then, ¾ cup sugar is added directly to the milk and cream on the stovetop until it dissolves over medium-low heat until just simmering. At this point you will add the cornstarch mixture until combined. Let that all cook for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add one heaping tsp of sea salt to custard on stovetop as it finishes thickening. Then strain into a heat-proof bowl. Add some gel-based teal food coloring.</li>
        <li>Into an ice cream machine it goes for about 25 minutes. </li>
        <li>After that’s done, pour into a piping bag in order to cleanly fill popsicle molds. Use stick alignment to assure sticks stand up straight, and in the freezer it goes for at least 6 hours up to overnight. </li>
        <li>Run under hot water to easily take out popsicles and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
